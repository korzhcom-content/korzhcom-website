                        First of all you may want to see Localizer at work. To do it - try to open one of our sample applications to learn how it is organized.
                        The source codes for Localizer's samples are available in the <code>[My Documents]\KorzhLocalizer\Samples\</code> folder (you can open this folder by selecting "Open Samples folder" menu item in Localizer's Start menu).
                        Just open one of the sample projects in your Delphi IDE and compile it. When it's compiled and run well - then try to switch the language and see if it works well.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-2">
                        After that you can try to apply Localizer to your own project. Read the following knowledge base article to get an idea how to start with this task.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-2">
                        To proceed further with your project localization you can read How to translate using Language Manager and How to use Localizer in your code articles.
                    </li>
