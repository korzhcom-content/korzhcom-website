                        First of all you may want to see Simple Query at work.
                        To do it - try to open one of our sample applications to learn how it is organized.
                        The source codes for Simple Query's samples are available in the <b>[InstallDir]\sq\demos\</b> folder
                        Just open one of the sample projects in your Delphi IDE and compile it.
                        The most handy demo project to start with is KQB.
                        When it's compiled and run well - then try to change or to add some conditions and/or columns, load another query and see how it works.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-2">
                        After that you can try to apply Simple Query to your own project. Just read "Getting started" topic in SimpleQuery's help file and follow the instructions placed there.
                    </li>
                </ol>
